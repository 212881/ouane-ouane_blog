 - Oct. 30th: I decided to change my device language into English. Now my smartphone, computer, TV are all configured in English.

- jan. 28th: I downloaded the "episode App" on my phone. I started reading story about many thing to improve my vocabulary. the one i enjoyed the most was "the kiss list" in this story was really good and the message too.

- Fev. 1st: i re-started to watch "the big bang theory" and "Naruto" in English with subtitles, it's really more funny than in French

- Fev 7th: I read 2 chapters of The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks. I found the book very interesting so far! It's quite sad but it's important to understand that we don't just work with cells. There are people and stories behind these cells.

- Fev 18th: i've asked to my friend which english level is more than mine to helph me. we're trying to talk only in english. it's not really easy because there're many thing in english i don't really know how to say it in the right context(vocabulary is really important) but it is also great manner to master words.

- March 1st: i started to select music i can listen in english. all of my favourite song are in english but all of them are not good to listen for me right now. for example when i listened cardi B, she says many thing that it is not really grammatically exact in english so i'm trying to avoid it and just keep singer who sing really in english. my favourites singers remain adele, lauren daigle, ed sheeran, lewis capaldi
