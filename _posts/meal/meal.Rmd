- jan. 28th: I downloaded the 'episode' App on my phone. I've started reading story about many thing to improve my vocabulary.

- Fev. 1st: i restarted to watch 'the big bang theory' and "Naruto" in English with subtitles, it's really more funny than in French

- Fev 7th: I read 2 chapters of The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks. I found the book very interesting so far! It's quite sad but it's important to understand that we don't just work with cells. There are people and stories behind these cells.

- Oct. 10th: I went to an English evening. It was nice. Even though I was a bit scared at first, it was easy to speak with people, as everyone has a different English level and I realised my English level is not that bad. I met nice people, an American guy from SHAPE and a Korean girl who's in Mons for a year.

- Oct. 22nd: I watched a documentary about abortion. Very serious topic and not fun at all but I learned a lot of interesting facts about abortion around the world.

- Oct. 27th: I started using Lyricstraining. This is soooo much fun. I love doing karaoke with my sister and we play together to guess the missing words. I love it!

- Oct. 30th: I decided to change my device language into English. Now my smartphone, PS4 and Ipad are all configured in English.

The bottom line is: have fun! It's a very important component when learning a new language.
