- jan. 28th: I have downloaded an application named "episode " on my phone. I have  started reading story about many thing to improve my vocabulary. the one i enjoyed  most was "the kiss list". it is about a girl who wanted to protect other from  bully in school since her elder sister try to suicide  after being bully by people in her school. problem was in image of  our society. i have read in the news many children who wanted to die due to bully in school or  in the social media.

- Fev. 1st: i have re-started to watch "the big bang theory" and my favorite amine "Naruto" in English with subtitles, it's really more funny than in French

- Fev 7th:  i have seen something about Henrietta Lacks, it was interesting i did not know who she was and i have make some research about her. i have almost read 3 chapters of "The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks". I found the book very interesting and sad but i have also learned many good thing.
she was an Afro-American woman who  died due to an invasive cancer.  Henrietta Lacks' cancer cells are found to have the unique characteristic of multiplying without limits when placed in the right conditions. their cells  helped scientists communities to develop  vaccine, to find how certain virus work for example they managed a vaccine against VPH  (it's a virus that infect woman's uterine), developed therapy against cancer(chemotherapy), improving fecundation "in vitro method". A lot of fantastic things that we are able to do now in the laboratory have started by analyzing these cells. it is amazing.
