| General topic     | the impact of obesity on cerebral plasticity                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Procedure         | -tested 15 obese people aged between 18 and 60 comparing to 15 other people in a healthy weight control group using a series of experiments involving transcranial magnetic stimulation
- repeat stimulation to see how strongly brain respond Conclusion/Discovery| the response in the obese group was minimal   |
| Conclusion        | - obesity was associated with impairs brain function
- these new finding suggest that losing weight is particularly important for healthy brain aged
- the ability of brain to find pathway is crucial to recovery                                                                                                 |
