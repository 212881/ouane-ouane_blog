| Procedure         |   -tested 15 obese people aged between 18 and 60 comparing to 15 other people in a healthy       |
|                   |   weight control group using a series of experiments involving transcranial magnetic stimulation |

|                   | - these new finding suggest that losing weight is particularly important for healthy brain aged  |
|                   | - the ability of brain to find pathway is crucial to recovery                                    |
