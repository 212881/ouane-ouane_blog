| General Topic      | Correlations between obesity and COVID-19                                                                                                                                      |
| Procedure          | *    Researchers suggest that fat has high amount of ACE2 receptors which is an entryway for the SARS-COV-2 virus on cells                                                     |
|                    | *  The increased numbers of these receptors in obese patients could lead to higher viral load because these ACE2 receptors.                                                    |
|                    | *  it  can be shed into circulation and end up in the lungs, specially increasing SARS-COV-2  concentration in lung tissue                                                     |
|                    | *  Researchers also note that overall inflammatory state that tends to accompany obesity, leads to a poor response to infection                                                |
|                    | *  Leaky gut is also increasing vulnerability to COVID-19 because of inflammation                                                                                              |
| Conclusion         | *  Obese patients are more likely to die because of covid-19.                                                                                                                  |
|                    | *  Fat accumulation increase their ACE2 receptors                                                                                                                              |
|                    | *  Dexamethasone could be helpful in obese patient because, this steroid reduced inflammation systematically                                                                   |
|                    | *  PPAR agonists is a class of drugs that have multiple effects including lowering inflammation, reducing ACE2 receptors;                                                      |
|                    |  *  PPAR can lowering blood sugar reducing LPS levels in circulation, and preventing fat cells in the lung from converting into a fibrotic cell type that can impair breathing |
|                    | *  PPAR agonists don't impair immunity and have fewer common side effects.                                                                                                     |
