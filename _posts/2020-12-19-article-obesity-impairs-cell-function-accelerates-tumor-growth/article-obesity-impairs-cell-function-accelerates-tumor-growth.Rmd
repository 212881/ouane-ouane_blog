| General topic       |  How obesity decrease immune cell function and accelerates tumor growth                      |
| Procedure           | Researchers examined tumor cell development in obese and non-obese mice                      |
| Conclusion/Discover | Tumor grows much more rapidly in animals on high-fat diets compared to those on normal diets |
|                     | Obesity and whole-body metabolism can change how different cells in tumors utilize fuel      |
|                     | Obesity reduced anti-tumor immunity in multiple cancer type                                  |
